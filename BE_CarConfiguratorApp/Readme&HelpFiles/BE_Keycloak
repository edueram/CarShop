+ Keyclock
    * After running keycloak container you can make some setting (like adding realm, client, url, ..)
      -> Enter in browser the url to your container (i.e.: localhost:8080)
      -> Enter login and password (admin, admin)
      -> Create new Realm--- use the same name like in backend and Frontend (i.e. api-gateway application.properties)
      -> Create new client (i.e Angular Client)
      -> Only Select the option - Standard Flow and nothing else,
          de-select the option Direct access grants that is enabled by default, we don't need it for our use case
      -> In "Valid redirect URls" enter http://localhost4200/*
      -> In "Web origines" enter http://localhost4200
      -> After creating a client go to realm-setting and activate User registration
